TODO List:


1) Create job lists for the room, then assign creeps around this
    a) for each spawn in the room create or remove an energy job
    b) for each extension in the room create or remove an energy job
    c) for each general use container in the room create or remove an energy job
    d) for each tower in the room create or remove an energy job
    e) if the room's storage has 300k energy create a job and share it

2) Create room upgrade path, the first 100

Main Base
---------
1) Tower placement (done for 1st tower, need to make robust for all rooms)
2) Tower function (need to find closest target)
3) Tower energy drop off
4) Creep upgrades for better creeps
5) Management system for which creep has what role
6) SpawnDesign
    a) checker pattern extensions with road
    b) build 1 unit off of spawn
7) Order for placing roads -> extensions -> containers -> towers
8) Source mining management
9) Wall building
10) Fighters
11) Room defense
12) store variables in Memory.room
13) Serialize paths to room data so no need to calculate anymore
12) have code check if spawn actually exists


Exploring
---------
1) Navigate out of room
2) Create specialized movement creep
3) Check room for people
4) create master list of explored rooms and if they have people
5) Spawn locator function
6)





Future
---------
1) Optimize data calls if possible
2) Dynamic structure for rooms
3) Optimize creep body parts
